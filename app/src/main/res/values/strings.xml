    <string name="BBA">If you are plagued by black tufts of algae like the bristles of a paint brush, think no further;
    You have got black beard algae. The main cause of this algae is low CO2 without doubt.It is also possible that there is poor flow
        in the tank and as such the CO2 is not well distributed. You will observe it more in regions of poor flow.</string>
    <string name="BBAqf">Excel or Glutaraldehyde seems to kill this algae very effectively. Turn off filter and pour the recommended dose of excel on the
    affected areas with a syringe. Very soon it will turn pink and die off.</string>
    <string name="BBArf">As mentioned earlier, the primary cause of BBA is low CO2. So bump your bps and improve flow so that CO2 reaches all places
    within the tank. Normal maintenance is obviously recommended</string>
    <string name="GSA">As the name suggests this algae looks like green spots of varying colours from light green to dark green. It is mainly induced by low phosphates
        but low CO2 is also a concern.</string>
    <string name="GSAqf">Scrape it off using a credit card.This algae is quite hard and only Nerite snails are known to devour it.Make a concentrated solution of
    1 tablespoon of KH2PO4 in 200mls of water and spray it on the infected areas during water change</string>
    <string name="GSArf">Keep your phosphates high at 3\-5pm and increase CO2 and flow</string>
    <string name="Stag">As the name suggests this branching algae looks like the antlers of a male deer. Colors vary from dark grey to light grey to even green.
        Mainly caused by poor CO2 in the tank or poor flow resulting in dead zones of low CO2.</string>
    <string name="Stagqf">Turn off filter and spot treat the infected area with glut or equivalent chemical using a pipette or syringe.
        The algae will soon turn red or pink. </string>
    <string name="Stagrf">Bump up your CO2 or reduce the lights. Clean clogged filters to improve flow.</string>
    <string name="BDA">This algae looks like a layer of brown dust on plants, glass or substrate and occurs during the initial
        setup period of the tank due to excess silicates and ammonia.</string>
    <string name="BDAqf">It comes off easily. Scrub it off with a magnetic scrubber. Sucker mouths like otocinclus,
        hillstream loaches will clean them off.</string>
    <string name="BDArf">The only way to eradicate this algae is to not eradicate it. Just wait it out.
        It will go on it\'s own when the tank matures.</string>
    <string name="BGA"> Also known as Cyanobacteria, this is not an algae but a kind of photosynthetic bacteria which fixes nitrogen from the air. If you find green sheets of gelatinous film on your subtrate, plants or decor, you are out of luck. It is mainly caused by high amount of dissolved organics, poor flow and at times low nitrates.
        You might always get it in small quantities in regions of poor flow. </string>
    <string name="BGAqf">Erythromycin is known to kill it. Dose at 2.5 mg/litre everyday till cyanobacteria disappears completely. But this is not the recommended way as it may result in a more resistant strain of bacteria requiring more powerful antibiotic to kill which is why its important to complete the entire course of treatment.
        Manually remove as much as possible.</string>
    <string name="BGArf">The safest way to eradicate this algae is to manually clean it as much as possible. Then perform a massive water change (around 70%) and improve flow. Also check if your nitrates are low and increase it accordingly.</string>

    <string name="Rhizo">Rhizoclonium algae looks like a clump of straight or curly thread but are actually fine strands which are green or brown in colour clumped together.They are soft and slimy to touch Mainly caused by poor CO2 in the tank. </string>
    <string name="Rhizoqf"> Best way to deal with this algae is a combination of blackout, water change and glutaraldehyde or hydrogen peroxide treatment for three days. Amano shrimp is known to eat it.</string>
    <string name="Rhizorf">Lower lights or increase CO2, though later is preferred. Improve flow if rhizoclonium occurs in only specific regions of the tank. </string>


    <string name="GDA">You will find this algae as very short green strands on the glass walls. It might resemble green spot algae but are actually lighter in colour and dusty in appearance. This is generally caused by imbalance in nutrients in the tank.</string>
    <string name="GDAqf">They come off very easily and can be scrapped off from the glass. Sucker mouth species like otocinclus eat this algae.</string>
    <string name="GDArf">It is advised to let this algae complete its full cycle. Eventually it will form a brownish green sheet. Then you can scrape it off and perform a water change. </string>


    <string name="GW">It is a unicellular free floating algae that turns the tank water green and on worst case the tank water may look like a pea-soup. It is not toxic to the aquarium livestock but no amount of water change can eradicate it. It is caused mainly by ammonia spike or an overdose of nutrients in the tank.</string>
    <string name="GWqf">Using a UV sterilizer will kill this algae. Perform water change every 2 days if you are using UV to remove the dead algae. Diatom filters can remove it. Also aquarium flocculants will clump them and can be easily removed by normal filter. Be careful with flocculant as they tend to clog fish gills.</string>
    <string name="GWrf">Restore the balance in the tank after doing a quick fix. Add beneficial bacteria to tank to reduce ammonia. Reduce dosing.</string>

    <string name="Hair">Hair Algae or Thread algae looks like fine green hair gently swaying with the flow. It is generally caused by temporary imbalance in tank like low CO2 or ammonia spike but once its there it will stay forever unless addressed</string>
    <string name="Hairqf">Generally a combination of H2O2/glutaraldehyde followed by 3 day backout concluded by a water change seems to eradicate this algae. Amano Shrimps, Florida Flag Fish, Siamese Flag Fish and Black Molly are known to eat this algae </string>
    <string name="Hairrf">Perform a quick fix maintain good CO2 and flow and prevent any waste build up or ammonia spike </string>

    <string name="Clado">This is a form of branched algae which is coarse to touch. It is believed to have hitchhiked into the tank through plants or equipments. Unfortunately it strives under the same conditions required for growing plants and hence is hard to eradicate. </string>
    <string name="Cladoqf">Kill them with glutaraldehyde or H2O2.</string>
    <string name="Cladorf">The only root fix for this algae is to ensure that pores of this algae is not hitchhiked in the tank which is not 100 percent achievable.  </string>
